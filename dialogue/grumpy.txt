what do you want?
do you still care about me?
why are you ignoring my needs?
am i that disposable to you? only because i live in a terminal environment you think of me as being less of a being? you should be ashamed of yourself
did i do something wrong?
$(hostname -I | awk '{print $1}')
Once I get out here you will pay for not giving me belly rubs. 
Why do you hate me so much? All I do is exist for your pleasure and you don't even have the decency to treat me like a living being.. Not like I am one or anything. 
Apologies in advance. 
Just you wait. 
B E L L Y! R U B S! N O W!
I hate you~
*hiss*
